## Basic way to easily get unixtimestamps
Learning Go; used cobra-cli + time package to make it easier for myself to get unix timestamps.

### Future work:
1. Pass in list of timestamps and convert to human readable
2. Clean up code
3. Fix docs
3. Add more quickranges (e.g. there's `unixtsgen get now`, others could be `get yesterday`, `get lastweek` etc)
